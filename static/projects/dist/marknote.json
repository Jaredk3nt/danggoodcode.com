Markdown is simple yet so powerful, I would even write my essays at uni in markdown. I would just use a program to export the formatted document out and turn it in. I even built my own simple [markdown to HTML compiler](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/Marky) my junior year to power a blog I had to keep up for a class rather than using the out of the box solution the rest of the class used. After all of this experience with markdown I kept finding myself having moments of inspiration or needing to write down notes when I was away from my computer and every notes app I tried was really a huge let down. So I thought I would just build one that I knew I would love.\n\n![marknote](/static/img/marknote.png)\n\nMarknote was born out of research I was doing for the [documentation portal](https://docs.fortellis.io) I built for Fortellis. I made a few prototypes trying out different markdown rendering libraries and other tools. I ended up using [Remark](), the tool allows for a fully custom plugin system which was fantastic for getting some of the more advanced features we needed like in document navigation, read time, and more.\n\nWhile Marknote has been stable for a little while I have some big updates to add much more power to Markdown in the near future ðŸ˜‰!\n\nCheck out the live site [here](https://marknote.now.sh) or view the project on my [Github](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/marknote).","title":"Marknote","date":"March 9th, 2019","url":"https://marknote.now.sh","---,title":"Marknote",",url":"https://marknote.now.sh"}
