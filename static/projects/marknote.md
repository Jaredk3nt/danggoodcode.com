I have always been infatuated with markdown, I don't think I have ever found a rich text editor that actually felt good to use. Markdown is simple yet so powerful, I would even write my essays at uni in markdown. I would just use a program to export the formatted document out and turn it in. I even built my own simple [markdown to HTML compiler](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/Marky) my junior year to power a blog I had to keep up for a class rather than using the out of the box solution the rest of the class used. After all of this experience with markdown I kept finding myself having moments of inspiration or needing to write down notes when I was away from my computer and every notes app I tried was really a huge let down. So I thought I would just build one that I knew I would love.

Marknote was born out of research I was doing for the [documentation portal](https://docs.fortellis.io) I built for Fortellis. I made a few prototypes trying out different markdown rendering libraries and other tools. I ended up using [Remark](), the tool allows for a fully custom plugin system which was fantastic for getting some of the more advanced features we needed like in document navigation, read time, and more.

While Marknote has been stable for a little while I have some big updates to add much more power to Markdown in the near future ðŸ˜‰!
